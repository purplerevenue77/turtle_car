# Project Proposal

1. Roughly, what will your drawing look like
i am going to create an outline of a BMW e30m3

2. What are two variables you could use so that when you change each variable, the drawing changes?

"def" and" for i in range (to repeat something)

3. Where is there repetition in your drawing?
yes, on the tires and on the general frame of the car. 


4. What are the main parts of your drawing? Are there clear sections or objects?

tire frame, windows and the general frame of the car which is the rest of it. 


5. How could you use a loop variable of a for loop? Is there somewhere in your drawing where something is repeated, but it's slightly different each time? Maybe the same object is repeated in different places, or maybe a similar object is repeated but with different sizes?

a place I could use a loop varible is the tires. they have the exact same dimensions. besides that, everything is slightly different than everything else.
